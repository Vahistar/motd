      Here are the steps to install any version you want (yep, even modpacks!) :3
      1) In the left-hand navigation bar, click the “More” button.
      2) From the available options, select:
          - Versions – if you’d like to install a clean Minecraft server (no modpacks, just the engine such as Paper, Forge, Fabric, or even a proxy).
          - Modpacks – if you’d like to install a specific modpack. You’ll get access to a catalog of modpacks from various sources, ready to install with just one click.
      3) After entering the chosen category, simply select the version or modpack you prefer and click Install.
          # Tip: For a smooth installation, remove all existing files first (you’ll see a popup for this).
 
      That’s it 🎉
      Your server is now ready to use! If you need any help, don’t hesitate to reach out to us on Discord.
 
      The BiteHost™ Team wishes you lots of fun!
