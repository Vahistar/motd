      Here are the steps to install any version you want (yep, even modpacks!) :3
      1) In the navigation bar, click the “More” button.
      2) From the options, choose:
            - Versions – to install a clean server (Paper, Forge, Fabric, proxy, etc.)
            - Modpacks – to install with just one click from the catalog of modpacks
      3) After entering the chosen category, simply select the version or modpack you prefer and click Install.
            # Tip: For a smooth installation, remove all existing files first (you’ll see a popup for this)
 
      That’s it 🎉
      Your server is now ready to use! If you need any help, don’t hesitate to reach out to us on Discord.
 
      The BiteHost™ Team wishes you lots of fun!
